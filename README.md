# Polynomial calculator

This is an application for a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which the user can enter polynomials, select the operation to be performed (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication,  derivative, integration) and display the result.

## Usage

The application will be used through the graphical user interface that appears after running the main.java class.

Here the user can introduce the polynomials they want to use .

The format for the  input is grouped in degree and coefficients, and for example, the polynomial 4*x^2+3*x+5 would have the degree “2” and coefficients “4 3 5” (the coefficients need to have ‘ ‘ between them).
